  <h3>🎮 CS2 Playervotes</h3>
  <p>Lightweight and efficient voting system for CS2 without anything pointless, allowing players to initiate votes for kicking, banning, and muting players. 
  <br>The plugin ensures fair play by requiring a configurable percentage of votes to pass before an action is taken.
  <br>Plugin uses commands css_ban, css_kick and css_mute so actions are stored into your site that shows punishments.</p>
